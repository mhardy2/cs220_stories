A mobile web application created for CS220: Human COmputer Interaction Fall 2017

**This application was designed exclusively for mobile use, and does not have complete functionality**

Problem Statement: 
Every day we are bombarded with an abundance of information on the internet from serious news to funny memes. 
The problem we hope to solve arises when important issues get buried in this onslaught of information. For example, 
you may hear about a terrible natural disaster but it turns into a blip in the onslaught of horrible news stories 
on the internet. Furthermore, it can be daunting to newcomers who want to support a cause, but might not know where 
to start. Searching on google is always a first choice, but being bombarded by an endless list of websites filled 
with information can be intimidating. This leaves people overwhelmed about important issues and even deterred from 
looking further because of the mass of information. There needs to be a way to isolate important issues, gather 
information on them, and provide ways people can take action all in one place.

Target Users:
College Students
1. Well-informed socially active (ie. attends protests, signs petitions) 
2. Well-informed but socially inactive
3. Un-informed and socially inactive
